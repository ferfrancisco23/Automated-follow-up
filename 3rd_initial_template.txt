Hope this finally finds you. Not so long ago, I sent you an email regarding writing an article for XXXXXXX. I hope you’ve received it. I’m starting to worry that it might have ended up in your junk folder.

Would you like me to resend my first message? I can also send you some topics ideas of mine right away for the post. Hoping to hear back from you soon!

Yours,
